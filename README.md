# EmailClientProject

This project was built using NodeJs, Express on the Back-End and Angular on the Font-End

## Requirement
Installed nodejs 11.10.0  <br>
Installed Angular CLI 7.3.1

## Development server
Npm install dependences: `npm install` <br>
Back-End: Run `node server.js` to start NodeJs server. (The server.js file is in the `backend` folder)<br>
Font-End: Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. <br>

## Quick live preview without having to install any package
I am running the app at an online IDE which can be preview here https://email-client-project-phandaika94.c9users.io:8081/ <br>
The online IDE does not run all the time. Therefore, I may need to start the IDE again in order for the above link to work. Please let me know if there is any problem. Thank you!
